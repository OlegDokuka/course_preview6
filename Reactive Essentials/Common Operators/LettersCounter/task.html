In this task you need to group stream of words by their first letter and calculate how many times that letter appears in all words in that group
<ul>
  <li>Group all the words by first letter</li>
  <li>Count how many times the first letter appears in the grouped words</li>
  <li>Summarize the counts and combine them with character that represents a group</li>
</ul>

For instance:
<p>
  <code>Flux("ABCA", "BCD", "ABC") -></code><br> - sequence of words
  <code>Flux(Group-'A'("ABCA", "ABC"), Group-'B'("BCD")) -></code><br> after grouping you have to have 2 groups - A and B
  <code>Flux(Tuple2('A', 3), Tuple2('B', 1))</code><br> - letter A appears 3 times in group A, 2 times in ABCA and once in ABC
</p>

<b>Because</b>:
<p>
  We have 2 words that starts with 'A' and every word in that group has in total 3 'A' appearance.
  <br>
  For the second group, 'B' happens only once in a single word so total is 1.
</p>

<!--        </tr>-->
<!--        <tr>-->
<!--            <td><code>onNext("ABCA") + onNext("ABC") | </code></td>-->
<!--            <td><code>key('A') with onNext("ABCA") + onNext("ABC") | </code></td>-->
<!--            <td><code>key('A') with onNext(3) </code></td>-->
<!--        </tr>-->

<div class="hint">
  Use <code>Flux#groupBy</code> to split stream of words by group where each group indicates first
  letter of the word so all the words in the group start from the same
  Use <code>Flux#concatMap</code> to flatten a group
  Use <code>GroupedFlux#key</code> to get access to the letter by which words were grouped
  Use <code>Flux#collect</code> to calculate sum
