In this task you need to compose multiple streams. Orders Streams which comes with
products in different currencies and currencies updates. Note, Currencies streams API
offers you an option to get actual currencies set as well as listen to the changes.
Note, if you listen to just currencies changes, the update from that stream may come
later in time so the orders processing progress may be "blocked" by that
